### File Based DB Idea

This takes a users input (index.html) and stores it in comments.txt (write.php does this), index.html also imports comments.txt and displays the contents.

### Set up

set-up.sh should do most of the set-up for you.

However I advise you run the commands one by one (manually), and make sure they complete (if you do this, you will have to prepend all of the commands with sudo)
