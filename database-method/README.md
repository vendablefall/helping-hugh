### MySQL DataBase Idea

Stores user input in the DB and shows it back on the main page.

### Setup

set-up.sh should do most of the set-up for you.

However I advise you run the commands one by one (manually), and make sure they complete (if you do this, you will have to prepend all of the commands with sudo)
